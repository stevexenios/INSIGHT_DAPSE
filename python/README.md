# Creating Avro Producers with Python and Confluent Kafka Library

For the project, I used kafka `2.`, and for the cluster setup I used the steps detailed in `setup` directory. Please review. For the python libraries, especially with regards to *Avro*, I am using confluent's library. There are way more benefits to using Confluent cloud or the platform, if resources are available, than using a direct kafka installation.
